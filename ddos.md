# Packet-flooding Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks and Defenses

Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, more generally coined
packet-flooding denial-of-service attacks on the Internet remain one of
the longest-running Internet infrastructure security threats and
challenges.  Many security threats seem to come and go, but attacks that
leverage the the packet carrying potential from a subset of controlled
hosts remain both effective in the damage they inflict and a challenge
in their ability to withstand would-be eradication attempts.  It is no
surprise therefore, that DDoS attack mitigation remains an ongoing area
where measurement and research occur.  The following is a sample of
scholarly papers that could form the basis of a written critique and
presentation (WCP) in the field of DDoS to satisfy UIC Computer Science
PhD degree requirements.
