# Secure and Trusted Routing

As one of the most critical Internet infrastructure subsystems, routing,
which usually implies specifically BGP in practice, is of utmost
importance to modern online communications.  Consequently, the security,
stability and trustworthiness of this system has been under near
constant evaluation, attracting a wide range of research attention.  One
particular aspect of the system is ensuring the distributed routing
information (i.e. announcements, withdrawals) are both authentic and
correct.  In recent years a growing body of work known collectively as
BGPSEC arose to provide framework for secure and trustworthy exchange of
routing information between autonomous systems.  The following is a
sample of scholarly papers that could form the basis of a written
critique and presentation (WCP)  in the field of routing security to
satisfy UIC Computer Science PhD degree requirements.
