# BGPSEC RPKI: Advances in Measurement, Adoption, and Deployment

As one of the most critical Internet infrastructure subsystems deployed
on the Internet, BGP routing is of utmost importance to modern online
communications.  Consequently the security, stability and
trustworthiness of this system has been under near constant evaluation,
attracting a wide range of research attention.  Ensuring distributed
routing information (i.e. announcements, withdrawals) are both authentic
and correct, a series of specifications under the umbrella termed BGPSEC
arose to add such security mechanisms to BGP.  BGPSEC calls for a
resource public key infrastructure (RPKI) to provide the foundation from
which trust can be setup and maintained.  BGPSEC deployment using RPKI
has begun to see some experimentation and limited deployment.  There are
active operational testbeds and research efforts underway to measure and
evaluate this RPKI infrastructure with proposals to encourage adoption
and deployment.  The following is a sample of scholarly papers that
could form the basis of a written critique and presentation (WCP) in the
field of BGPSEC RPKI to satisfy UIC Computer Science PhD degree
requirements.
