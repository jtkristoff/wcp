# The RPKI and Route Origin Validation: Advances in Deployment and Measurement

As one of the most critical Internet infrastructure subsystems deployed on the
Internet, BGP inter-domain routing is of utmost importance to modern online
communications.  Consequently the security, stability, and trustworthiness of
this system has been under near constant evaluation, attracting a wide range of
research attention.  Ensuring distributed routing information is both authentic
and correct, a series of specifications in the IETF Secure Inter-Domain Routing
working group arose to enable authentication of BGP routing information.  The
Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is a system that enables route origin
validation (ROV) and AS path validation (also known as BGPsec) .  Deployment of
RPKI systems has begun.  Meanwhile some networks are beginning to sign routes
and perform ROV in production networks.  Researchers are actively conducting
experiments that both measure and encourage deployment of these secure routing
extensions.  The following are a short list of scholarly papers that could form
the basis of a written critique and presentation (WCP) on RPKI and ROV to
satisfy UIC Computer Science PhD degree requirements.
