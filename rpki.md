# BGPSEC RPKI: A Survey of Deployment and Adoption

As one of the most critical Internet infrastructure subsystems deployed on the
Internet, BGP routing is of utmost importance to modern online communications.
Consequently the security, stability and trustworthiness of this system has
been under near constant evaluation, attracting a wide range of research
attention.  Ensuring distributed routing information (i.e. announcements,
withdrawals) are both authentic and correct, a series of specifications under
the umbrella termed BGPSEC arose to add such security mechanisms to BGP.
BGPSEC calls for a resource public key infrastructure (RPKI) to provide the
foundation from which trust can be setup and maintained.  BGPSEC deployment
using RPKI has begun to see some experimentation and limited deployment.  There
is active operational testbeds and research efforts underway to measure and
evaluate this RPKI infrastructure.  The following is a sample of scholarly
papers that could form the basis of a written critique and presentation (WCP)
in the field of BGPSEC RPKI to satisfy UIC Computer Science PhD degree
requirements.
