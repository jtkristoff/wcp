	abstract = {Performing Route Origin Validation (ROV) to filter BGP announcements, which contradict Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) is critical for protection against BGP prefix hijacks. Recent works quantified ROV enforcing Autonomous Systems (ASes) using control-plane experiments. In this work we show that control-plane experiments do not provide accurate information about ROV-enforcing ASes. We devise data-plane approaches for evaluating ROV in the Internet and perform both control and data-plane experiments using different data acquisition sources. We analyze and correlate the results of our study to identify the number of ASes enforcing ROV, and hence protected with RPKI. We perform simulations with the ROV-enforcing ASes that we identified, and find that their impact on the Internet security against prefix hijacks is negligible. As a countermeasure we provide recommendations how to cope with the main factor hindering wide adoption of ROV.},

	abstract = {As the rollout of secure route origin authentication with the RPKI slowly gains traction among network operators, there is a push to standardize secure path validation for BGP (i.e., S*BGP: S-BGP, soBGP, BGPSEC, etc.). Origin authentication already does much to improve routing security. Moreover, the transition to S*BGP is expected to be long and slow, with S*BGP coexisting in "partial deployment" alongside BGP for a long time. We therefore use theoretical and experimental approach to study the security benefits provided by partially-deployed S*BGP, vis-a-vis those already provided by origin authentication. Because routing policies have a profound impact on routing security, we use a survey of 100 network operators to find the policies that are likely to be most popular during partial S*BGP deployment. We find that S*BGP provides only meagre benefits over origin authentication when these popular policies are used. We also study the security benefits of other routing policies, provide prescriptive guidelines for partially-deployed S*BGP, and show how interactions between S*BGP and BGP can introduce new vulnerabilities into the routing system.},

However, the security benefits provided by the RPKI are accomplished via an architecture that empowers centralized authorities to unilaterally revoke any IP prefixes under their control. We propose mechanisms to improve the transparency of the RPKI, in order to mitigate the risk that it will be used for IP address takedowns. First, we present tools that detect and visualize changes to the RPKI that can potentially take down an IP prefix. We use our tools to identify errors and revocations in the production RPKI. Next, we propose modifications to the RPKI's architecture to (1) require any revocation of IP address space to receive consent from all impacted parties, and (2) detect when misbehaving authorities fail to obtain consent. We present a security analysis of our architecture, and estimate its overhead using data-driven analysis.},

This is due to inherent, possibly insurmountable, obstacles, including the need to replace today's routing infrastructure, meagre benefits in partial deployment and online cryptography. We propose path-end validation, a much easier to deploy alternative to BGPsec. Path-end validation is a modest extension to RPKI that does not require modifications to BGP message format nor online cryptography. Yet we show, through extensive simulations on empirically-derived datasets, that path-end validation yields significant security benefits, even with very limited partial deployment.

	abstract = {As the Internet's \textit{de facto} interdomain routing protocol, the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the glue that holds the disparate parts of the Internet together. A major limitation of BGP is its failure to adequately address security. Recent high-profile outages and security analyses clearly indicate that the Internet routing infrastructure is highly vulnerable. Moreover, the design of BGP and the ubiquity of its deployment have frustrated past efforts at securing interdomain routing. This paper considers the current vulnerabilities of the interdomain routing system and surveys both research and standardization efforts relating to BGP security. We explore the limitations and advantages of proposed security extensions to BGP, and explain why no solution has yet struck an adequate balance between comprehensive security and deployment cost.},

	abstract = {Malicious BGP route hi-jacks and and accidental mis-originations continue to threaten the security and robustness of the global Internet. Over the last several years the IETF, RIRs, router vendors, and researchers have developed and implemented an approach to BGP origin validation based upon a global resource public key infrastructure (RPKI) that permits operators anywhere in the Internet to detect unauthorized route announcements and implement local polices to mitigate (e.g., filter) these events.

This track will examine the current state of RPKI Origin Validation (ROV) technologies: products, services, implementations, configurations, and tool sets that could be useful to operators in planning, deploying, and monitoring ROV use in their networks. Actual operational experiences with ROV deployment will be described as well as issues that need to be addressed to further operational deployment.

	abstract = {The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) provides mechanisms for preventing BGP prefix hijack attacks. RPKI uses certificate which bind IP address blocks to owners’ public keys and it enables routers to perform Route Origin Validation (ROV). This allows routers to filter bogus announcements hence preventing IP prefix hijacking. Yet, despite extensive efforts, RPKI’s deployment is frustratingly sluggish, leaving the Internet largely insecure. We tackle fundamental questions regarding today’s RPKI’s deployment and security: What is the adoption status of RPKI and ROV? What are the implications for global security of partial adoption? What are the root-causes for slow adoption? How can deployment be pushed forward? We address these questions through a combination of empirical analyses, a survey of over 100 network practitioners, and extensive simulations. Our study measuring ROV enforcement, reveals disappointingly low adoption at the core of the Internet. We show, in contrast, that without almost ubiquitous ROV adoption by large ISPs significant security benefits cannot be attained. We also expose a critical security vulnerability: about a third of RPKI authorizations issued for IP prefixes do not protect the prefix from hijacking attacks. We examine potential reasons for scarce adoption of RPKI and ROV, including human error in issuing RPKI certificates and inter-organization dependencies, and present recommendations for addressing these challenges.},

The primary function of a BGP speaking system is to exchange network reachability information with other BGP systems. This network reachability information includes information on the list of Autonomous Systems (ASes) that reachability information traverses. This information is sufficient for constructing a graph of AS connectivity for this reachability from which routing loops may be pruned, and, at the AS level, some policy decisions may be enforced. BGP-4 provides a set of mechanisms for supporting Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). These mechanisms include support for advertising a set of destinations as an IP prefix, and eliminating the concept of network "class" within BGP. BGP-4 also introduces mechanisms that allow aggregation of routes, including aggregation of AS paths. This document obsoletes RFC 1771. [STANDARDS-TRACK]},

To validate these negative beliefs, we carry out a comprehensive analysis of (IP prefix, its origin AS) pairs in BGP against the corresponding information registered with the IRR, and vice versa. Considering the BGP and IRR practices, we propose a methodology to match the (IP prefix, origin AS) pairs between the IRR and BGP. We observe that the practice of registering IP prefi xes and origin ASes with the IRR is prevalent. However, the quality of the IRR data can vary substantially depending on routing registries, regional Internet registries (to which ASes belong), and AS types. We argue that the IRR can help improve the security level of BGP routing by making BGP routers selectively rely on the corresponding IRR data considering these observations.},
